- A simple generic program that solves any 2D maze and returns the full path that was visited during searching for the goal node, then it returns also the shortest path itself.

- The input consists of the rows of the 2D maze seperated by spaces.

   Sample input:
   S,.,.,#,.,.,. .,#,.,.,.,#,. .,#,.,.,.,.,. .,.,#,#,.,.,. #,.,#,E,.,#,.

   Where:
	  S --> The starting node
          . --> Available position (valid move)
          # --> Obstacle (not valid move)
	  E --> The goal node
